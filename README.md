# Machine Learning (ML) library

A standard machine learning library written in Java.
It contains several pieces of code/methods/functions that are related with ML and useful
for my research. More funtions and algorithms are being developed (mostly when I need them).
Nevertheless if someone uses the code and requires a specific method or optimization, just ask.

## Prerequisites

Most of my code requires a library named [utils](https://github.com/mariolpantunes/utils)
This library is no exception.
Currently it requires Java 8.

## Installation

The whole project was done in Maven, as such to install this library just run:
```
mvn install
```
